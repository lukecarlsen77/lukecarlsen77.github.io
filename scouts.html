    <h1>Scouts</h1>
    <h2>My Experience</h2>
    <h3> I joined just about a year ago in october, but I have already learned a lot of first aid and life skills like what to do when you get lost or how to start a fire anywhere. I have gone a lot of monthly campouts, and all of them have been fun.</h3>
    <h2>My favorite Campouts</h2>
    <h3> One of my favorite campouts was murray lodge because we stayed in a lodge at marin sierra and although it was cold it was cool to see the entire lake frozen over and having snowball fights. I think the best part of the campout I think was the evening we spent playing uno or trying to scare eachother.</h3>
    <h3> Another one of my favorite campouts was actually the week long summer camp also at marin sierra where I learned lifesaving and first aid but also had a lot of fun playing in the unfrozen lake and also I celebrated my birthday there.</h3>
