    <h1>Chinese</h1>
    <h2>My Education</h2>
    <h3> I started learning chinese from a community of people who taught off of textbooks at a church in tiburon. I started taking classes in 3rd grade and recently graduated last year after 8th grade. I am now taking an online course for the credits but I feel like this chinese school has helped me a lot and make new friends. Also the picture below is of me who is to the right of the teacher in a gray t-shirt at chinese school in 3rd grade.</h3>
