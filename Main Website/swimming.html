    <h1>Swimming</h1>
    <h2>My journey</h2>
    <h3>I started swimming in 2022 with some friends and started to enjoy it. I took a little break in 2023 but came back with faster and better times in 2024e. I have now quit because it is to time consuming and I don't think I can make the redwood team but now I know how to swim for the rest of my life.</h3>
    <h2>My old team</h2>
